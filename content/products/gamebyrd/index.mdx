## Gamebyrd

The swift transformation of the video-rental industry (R.I.P
brick-and-mortar movie rental companies) left a void within the hearts
of many gamers. As the market moved towards digital entertainment
streaming, the ability to rent anything from new video games to
childhood classics was lost.

Enter Gamebyrd - an internal project with a simple concept: deliver
games, consoles, and accessories to your door as quickly as a pizza.

## Two Weeks to Create or Bust

We’ve got a need for speed. Our design methodology for web
applications focuses on getting a working prototype in the user’s
hands as quickly as possible. This doesn’t mean cutting corners – it
just means working efficiently. By receiving feedback from users early
and often, we were able to validate assumptions and adjust on the fly.
For internal Caldera initiatives, we allow two weeks to create a
working prototype - either an interactive mockup for more complex apps
or a deployed alpha version for simpler ones.

We start with the basics. By defining the overarching goal of the
project and exploring the customer need, we were able to design around
a defined value statement. There was no need to make this complicated
– this is why we followed a template, similar to a modified business

## Minimum Viable Product

We think of a product as a collection of features that work together
to solve a customer’s problem. It is all about needs vs. wants. What
is important to know is what features are completely and totally
necessary for the experience. In our process, each user journey is
mapped out and features in the app are prioritized accordingly. For
Gambyrd, we were confident that users would need to search, add items
to a cart, give payment information, and receive notifications.

All journey maps for minimum viable products are based on the
end-user. Yes – we could have applied more dynamic processes like
automating the order flow, automatically generating routes,
programmatically contacting drivers to deliver games, etc. – but were
those pertinent to the preliminary testing of the app? These are
scenarios we had to think through. Without first validating that this
idea was something the user would adopt, we risked spending time and
money on things that might not matter. And so, the needs outweighed
the wants.

## Where it is Now

Our end product was demoed to a cohort of roughly 25 people with
mainly positive feedback. After moving through some personal
demonstrations to prospective users, our team ultimately decided
to cease development on the app. Between the logistical hurdles
and new developments in the retro games space (looking at you
NES classic), we decided it wasn’t a product to continue with
into the future. But man, did our imaginations have fun with
this one.
